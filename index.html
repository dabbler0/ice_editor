<p><strong>If you're a beginner,</strong> ICE Editor is a block language, like Scratch -- approachable and fun.</p>

<p><strong>Once you're not,</strong> ICE Editor is a text editor. Like vim or emacs -- nothing more, and nothing less.</p>

<p>ICE Editor a reimagination of block languages -- languages like Scratch, or AppInventor. Block languages are a huge success in the realm of getting kids into programming -- the existence of a palette jumps all of the first hurdles (syntax and memorizing constructions) that kids encounter, and also provides gentle inspiration for little projects. There are three problems with the current block languages:</p>

<ol>
<li>They don't scale. Although Scratch is good at making small animations or games, it gets extremely slow as programs grow, and eventually both editing and running become extremely unweildy.</li>
<li>They're abnormal. No professional programmer makes programs in Scratch.</li>
<li>Kids get stuck. Although kids get very good at making Scratch games, syntax languages still seem foreign, boring, and scary, and kids never move out of the block language realm.</li>
</ol><p>ICE Editor attempts to solve all these problems. The philosophy is that blocks are just extended syntax highlighting, and your blocks are just a text editor for an existing, professionally-used language. So kids are seeing real syntax right from the start. This solves all three issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Of course it scales, at least as much as anything can. We're just editing JavaScript, or Java, or C, or Python, or whatever the language mode of choice is, so we're as fast and memory efficient as they are.</li>
<li>It's normal. ICE just becomes a choice of "favorite editor", like Eclipse, or vim, or emacs. Kids can pull code from real development teams, work on it like a professional, and put it back as if they had edited it with a normal editor. In fact, it is a normal editor. Its syntax highlighting is just a bit more heavy-handed.</li>
<li>Kids don't get stuck. They see syntax right from the start. Ideally, as kids get more and more familiar with their palette, they start to get annoyed (as many people have on the Blockly forums) with having to search to find the block they want. So, once they know the block they want, they can just insert it by hand by typing in the editor. It's just a text editor, so it works that way. Blocks form around the text as you type, just like syntax highlighting.</li>
